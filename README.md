Wan Ahmad Luqman Al-Hakim Wan Azmi 1814213

Explaination:
For the submission, I have uploaded 3 file: StudentController, web.php, and student.blade.php.
In the web.php, the route are created to post the input from the login page to students and to call the function getData();
To validate from the server-side input, in the getData() function validate the input from the users. As it is required to fill in the blank, build-in function : validate() was used to implement the server side validation.
HTML and form code were in the Students.blade.php. It also contain the client-side validation using the parsley.js to validate the required length and input type to be inserted in the box.
